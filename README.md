### "What is this?"

   This is a human-rate linkedin job application bot written in python using the Helium Selenium webdriver frontend that applies for jobs posted using the "Easy apply" feature. As the settings are right now, it will net you a few hundred jobs per day, saving you carpal tunnel symptoms. However it does require human intervention from time to time.

### "Why did you code this?"

  - I got very depressed in my job hunt. I would sit down & apply for approximately 10 to 20 jobs related to the specialties I am studying. 
   - Sometimes I would get a hit, often I wouldn't. When I did get a hit, I would get one of the following: 
        1. "Complete this algorithm using concepts not taught to you in your C++ Algorithms class that ended at trees within 9 hours"
        2. Ghosting me after completing a simple algorithm using concepts that were actually taught to me.
        3. "We looked at your github, it doesn't appear you have done any work for free (e.g. contribute to open software projects), get back to us when you have"
        4. From a big company: "We believe you need guidance, maybe you should get hired at a small company?"
        5. From a small company: "This is a very mission-critical role, maybe you should get hired at a large company?"
   - The only singular job I have been actually offered said they would give me 25,000$ salaried to be a Team Lead for a team using a language I had yet to use, and do a 1hr30min commute to work each day. They did no coding interview, said "Oh you've got it!", and showed me a coffee shop they bought which in their words "Would be open 24 hours so developers could even sleep in here if they wanted to!". Red flags everywhere.
    
### "This looks like shit"

   - Yeah, it's very simple functional decomposition and error handling, I was primarily inspired by two ideas I've recently read:
   1. https://www.jarednelsen.dev/posts/The-horrifically-dystopian-world-of-software-engineering-interviews
   2. I recently read from an individual that software development is not about solving increasingly difficult algorithms, rather it is instead about solving "problems" that one encounters. This is my attempt at that.
  
  
  
### "Are you afraid of Linkedin taking action?"


  I don't precisely have much that I'm risking, if they ask me to take it down I will. If they decide to take much harsher action, I'll just lay in my bed for a few days again.
